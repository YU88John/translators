# Solving my often-faced issue 

Personally, I'm familiar with both json and yaml formats.

Since I feel more confident with `yaml`, all my configurations are mostly written in yaml. Consequently, I often face issues(mostly syntax) while converting certain `json` files to `yaml`.
In my spare time, I decided to develop a conversion tool with Python. I love using self-developed tools rather than random online tools.

As of now, I only have written `json-yaml`. However, I will try working on vice versa in a moment.
